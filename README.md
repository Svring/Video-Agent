# Video Agent, a video caption writter for model training

Nowadays I got a job at a data company, despite the fact that my professional(not that pro though...) skills are neglected somehow, I'm still glad to claim the honor as a useful human.

Then the question comes up, the web interface of my workbench, which I would not describe as a bit of unhandy, but only analogize as a pain in the ass, is literally ruining my weekdays.

So here it is, this tool is rudimentary enough to showcase my unprofessionality and mature enough(still growing though...) to ease my pain...slightly.

More developments are on the way, before I got fired, who knows which comes first.

It seems absolutely nonsense to say that video captioning feels like rocket science, but it does make sense to say so.
